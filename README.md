### Abstract
 
This is a portable version of the classic game connect 4! I've been playing around with this 3 button + screen configuration! First the [spotify display](https://github.com/Dongathan-Jong/SpotifyDisplay/edit/main/README.md) (see below), and now this. The possibilities are pretty endless with this, and it's kind of a chain of desk gadgets I'm creating. I wanted to challenge myself with specifically connect 4, as the game logic may seem simple on the surface, but is so hard to implement in code. Through coding this, the number of debugging sessions genuinely hurt my brain. 

### Features

- Runs off 3v3! Very low energy consumption
- Could add a battery for full portability
- Thats about it ðŸ˜­ it's just a super dumb handheld console

### Build 

The case was created in fusion 360 (see f3z file), and somewhat a port of the spotify display design. Since I copied most of the design, it only took ~30 min. As for the physical parts, this uses:  
- ESP32 C3
- ST7735 1.8" Colour TFT display
- 3x Cherry MX switch

### I want to build one! 

The code is fully open source, and super easy to change! If you decide to use a different MCU, I have all the pin definitions here:
